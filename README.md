# Fantasy Map Generator (Work in Progress)

This program is an implementation of a fantasy map generator based on the methods described in Martin O'Leary's "Generating fantasy map" notes (https://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/).

## Generating Irregular Grids

A Poisson Disc Sampler generates a set of random points with the property that no two points are within a set radius of eachother.

The set of points are triangulated in a Delaunay triangulation. The triangulation is stored in a doubly connected edge list (DCEL) data structure.

The dual of the Delaunay triangulation is computed to produce a Voronoi diagram, which is also stored as a DCEL.

Each vertex in the Delaunay triangulation becomes a face in the Voronoi diagram, and each triangle in the Delaunay triangulation becomes a vertex in the Voronoi diagram. A triangle is transformed into a vertex by fitting a circle to the three triangle vertices and setting the circle's center as the position of a Voronoi vertex. The following image displays the relationship between a Delaunay triangulation and a Voronoi diagram.

The vertices in the Voronoi diagram will be used as the nodes in an irregular grid. Note that each node has exactly three neighbours.

## Generating Terrain

An initial height map is generated using a set of primitives:
- addHill - Create a rounded hill where height falls off smoothly
- addCone - Create a cone where height falls off linearly
- addSlope - Create a slope gradient that runs parallel to a line

and a set of operations:
- normalize - Normalize the height map values to [0,1]
- round - Round height map features by normalizing and taking the square root of the height values
- relax - Replace height values with the average of their neighbours
- setSeaLevel - Translate the height map so that the new sea level is at zero

Contour lines are generated from the Voronoi edges. If a contour line is generated for some elevation h, a Voronoi edge will be included in the countour if one of its adjacent faces has a height less than h while the other has a height greater than or equal to h.

A flow map is generated by tracing the route that water would flow over the map. At each point on the grid, a path must be traced downhill to the edge of the map. This means that there can be no sinks or depressions within the height map. Depressions are filled by using the [Planchon-Darboux Algorithm](http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/sous_copyright/010031925.pdf) to ensure that a path to the edge of the map exists for all grid points.

The height map is then eroded by using the flow map data and terrain slope data.

Paths representing rivers are generated at points where the amount of flux (river current) is above some threshold. The path of the river follows the flow map until it reaches a coastline or the edge of the map.

The height map is shaded based upon the horizontal component of the slope. Short strokes are drawn at faces where the slope is above some threshold. Strokes pointing upwards from left to right are drawn if the height map is sloping upward from left to right, and strokes pointing downward from left to right are drawn if the height map is sloping downward from left to right.
